Then you achieve everything you want.; My latest dream is to become a Web Developer; I finished recently Kodilla Bootcam where I learned many usefull stuff related to Web Development; I don`t want to stop developing myself so the question who I'm going to be is still open; Besides coding, you can meet me mostly snowboarding or playing tennis. Recently I love a little instrument called harmonica that has great acoustic colour, especially when playing blues music.",
